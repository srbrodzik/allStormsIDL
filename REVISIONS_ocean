REVISION HISTORY

original code in /home/disk/shear2/brodzik/matlab/ULLI.stormStats/
This code have a slight modification in the coding to identify individual storms
The id is performed using findstorm code to locate first all contiguous pixels
that corresponds to a reflectivity greater than zero and then, after the id of 
individual cluster of pixels it is applied the theresholds to account for the 
classification (e.g., convective pixels and reflectivity >= 40 dBZ)
  
v3 update: this code now does the classification into a broad stratiform, deep convective and
wide convective containing storms using the respective theresholds

v5 update: change the definition of the threshold used for Deep convective core
           as all events that have higher altitude greater than 10km. In addition, 
           the output file now replace the column of height of the core by the higher 
           and lower level of the storm
  
v54 is a run with a new set of processed data (there were mismatch in the interpolated data)
    There were no changes into the code!     
  
v6 this is the code that aggregates all computations from Identifing all storms, compute statistics
   aggregates accumulated maps, compute rainfall accumulations and lighting maps.

v7 this is the code that removes all lighting maps info (there is
no LIS on the GPM) and all references to latent heating
Also made SH (shallow isolated) calculations optional since those
calcs are done in LandRuns version of allStorms

v8 comments out all references to ZR (R11) rain

v9 uses uncompressed netcdf files as input and adds in some
           mods dealing with new naming
           convention for ex_data_v05 input files
   changed some input dim and var names due to new file format
   removed 'date' and 'time' vars in code and replaced them with
           'datetime' var
  
v9_uw uses rain_type_uw for calculations
  
v10m outputs masks for BSR, DCC, DWC, WCC cores using moderate thresholds
     change all 'gt 2' pixel checks to 'ge 2'
     add degPix to all lat/lon dimensions
     replace 10,20,30,40 with STRA,CONV,OTHER,SHIS
  
v11m corrects stats_class outputs by
     putting intializations of RTo_xxxx inside of main loop
     using different variable names for NSR and R11 RTo_xxxx core variables
     added test for depth of CV (old way just checked top ht) to test for DCC

v11m_v06 uses native v06 raintype in calcs
     ADDED TEST FOR DCC TO BE BASED ON dim_topCV AND dim_hgtCV
        (old way just checked dim_topCV)
  
v12m_v06 Modularize entire code
     Corrected get_rain_accum - in loop for creating accum rain rate vectors,
          last else: replace raintype[col,row] with raintypeFULL[col,row]
